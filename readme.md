# Introduction to Numpy 

Numpy stands for Numerical Python and it's a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides python with an extensive math library capable of performing numerical computations effectively and efficiently. 


In the following lessons we will learn:

1. How to import NumPy
2. How to create multidimensional NumPy ndarrays using various methods
3. How to access and change elements in ndarrays
4. How to load and save ndarrays
5. How to use slicing to select or change subsets of an ndarray
6. Understand the difference between a view and a copy an of ndarray
7. How to use Boolean indexing and set operations to select or change subsets of an ndarray
8. How to sort ndarrays
9. How to perform element-wise operations on ndarrays
10. Understand how NumPy uses broadcasting to perform operations on ndarrays of different sizes.
